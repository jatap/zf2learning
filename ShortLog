      Stronger typing on error views to avoid E_FATAL and hide exceptions if display_exceptions is not set to true
      Fixing configuration according with changes done to router initializationThis change just moves router configuration to instance configuration of the router itself. The change is necessary to allow the router to be injected into other instances of the DiC and to eventually switch the router type to a custom one with own dependencies and eventually completely unaware of the default Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack. These changes are related to https://github.com/Ocramius/zf2/compare/zendframework%3Amaster...mvc-router-from-locator

      Inject the PluginBroker into the ActionController so that we pick up any module's controller plugins that they have injected into it. By injecting into ActionController, all controllers that extend it will automatically pick up this injection without having to inject themselves which of course saves a lot of typing for developers and stops them wondering why a given plugin isn't working in a particular controller\!
      Inject the plugin loader into Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginBroker by default to simplify injecting controller plugins
